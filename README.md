# ACADEMIC PORTFOLIO

a compilation of my works from my time as an undergrad at the UH COA. This site can be viewed live at ![ryanerbert.com](ryanerbert.com)

***

> This project was physically started in 2015, planned out in concept much earlier, within the duration of my time at the University of Houston College of Architecture. After applying for an independent study course with Professor Michael Gonzales, I spent a semester focusing on learning basic programming as a means for marketing architectural concepts. the final product, in my eyes, was a project that laid the groundwork for this site you are looking at now.
>
> this site was built with heavy inspiration from big.dk, with some modifications for personalization. The projects themselves are hosted on a private server and running via the Wordpress framework.
>
> Upon starting this project, I decided to use the p5.js library. while my coursework focused on Processing, which runs on Java, many browsers had made the announcement that they would no longer be supporting the Java language due to security issues. With this knowledge, I moved to p5 as a viable alternative, as my interests laid in producing content for web. *due to this decision, I am unfortunately not able to make this page responsive for mobile use, limiting the intended experience to users with a computer*
>
> Since the creation of this project, I have taken a Udacity course on Front-End Web Development (sponsored by the Grow with Google scholarship program), have worked for a year in a programming-oriented role, and have worked on a handful of personal projects.
